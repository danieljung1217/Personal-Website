# 2048
This project is an implementation of the popular game 2048 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Players can use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to push blocks around and combine them.
The objective is to combine enough blocks in the 4x4 grid to get to the number 2048.

## How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in the respective direction.
Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide, doubling the value.
The goal is to reach the tile with a value of 2048.

## Features

Tiles are styled with different colors for better visualization.
Score is displayed, and the game over condition is checked.

## File Structure
